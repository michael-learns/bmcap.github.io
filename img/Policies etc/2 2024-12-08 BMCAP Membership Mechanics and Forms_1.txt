BMCAP MEMBERSHIP MECHANICS, QUALIFICATIONS, AND RULES

MEMBERSHIP TYPES AND QUALIFICATIONS

o Professional Experience: Open to aspiring professionals and practicing
consultants with relevant experience in business, management, or related
fields. While no specific years of experience are required, applicants should
demonstrate expertise or interest in consulting or a related area of specialty.
o Certification: Membership requires relevant certifications such as the
Postgraduate Certification in Business and Management Consulting (PGC-BMC)
from AIM-SEELL, CMC, CPA, RFP, or equivalents. Certifications should align
with the applicant’s field of expertise (e.g., HR, finance, technology).
o Professional Ethics: Adherence to BMCAP’s Code of Ethics and commitment to
ongoing professional development.
2. Associate Members
o Requirements: Open to individuals transitioning to or starting a career in
consulting, as well as practicing consultants. This membership type serves as a
one-year assessment period to evaluate if the member is suited to progress to
Regular Membership. Applicants must commit to completing a certification
within this period if not already certified.
o Benefits: Access to mentorship, training workshops, and networking events.
3. Regular Members
o Requirements:
▪ Completion of one year as an Associate Member in good standing.

Additional Notes on Membership Progression
• Applicants joining as Associate Members should be informed that the one-year period
serves as an evaluation phase to ensure alignment with BMCAP’s values and standards.
• Certification is necessary to progress to Regular Membership. The one-year period
provides sufficient time for members to pursue and complete a certification program
relevant to their consulting or professional expertise.
• Those unable to meet the certification requirement within a year may remain as
Associate Members until requirements are fulfilled.
